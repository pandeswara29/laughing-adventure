Hi everyone. My name is Gill Cleeren, and welcome to my course, GitHub Fundamentals. I'm a freelance solution architect focusing on mobile and web projects. GitHub is the world's favorite social coding platform. It's used by millions of developers around the world. A lot of developers use GitHub in combination with Git as their source management system, which is of course its main goal, but can you work with Git and GitHub efficiently, and do you know what other features it brings? This course will teach you how to work with Git and GitHub in an efficient way. You'll learn how you can work with GitHub repositories, branches, forks, and pull requests, but GitHub offers much more including project management, wikis to create documentation, team management, and even static page hosting. Some of the major topics that we'll cover include learn Git and its most commonly used commands using the command line interface, get a deep understanding of GitHub repositories, how you can create branches and forks, understand the GitHub flow using pull requests, see how you can use GitHub for your organization, including project management, wikis, and team management. By the end of this course, you'll have a good understanding of how you can use GitHub for your personal and professional projects, even within your organization. No prior knowledge is expected for this course. I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn how to use GitHub efficiently, with the GitHub Fundamentals course, here on Pluralsight.
